Babington,

The plan to put me on the throne has one major block.
The Pope knows my legitimacy as a Catholic
How can a Protestant reign? If we are to succeed,
We must assassinate Elizabeth. The affairs being thus prepared,
I may suddenly be transported out of this place.
You are to rescue me from Chartley Castle at the earliest.

The Queen of Scots
