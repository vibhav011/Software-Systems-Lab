Hi. Long time since we met each other by dear siss!!! I was reading this book, bought it for $13.99. Found a line - When we were children, Hassan and I used to climb the $(1,0,0,0)#(3,6)$ trees in the driveway of my father's house and annoy our neighbours by reflecting sunlight onto their homes. This reminded me of our childhood. I wish to fly back to $(0,1,0,0,4)#(1)$ once this gets over and buy you and a $(1,1,1,1,1)#(4,4)$. #sis_goals. Signing off $$Sara$$.
